        <span>Barbie is a fashion doll manufactured by the American toy company Mattel, Inc. and launched in March 1959. American businesswoman Ruth Handler is credited with the creation of the doll using a German doll called Bild Lilli as her inspiration.

            Barbie is the figurehead of a brand of Mattel dolls and accessories, including other family members and collectible dolls. Barbie has been an important part of the toy fashion doll market for over sixty years, and has been the subject of numerous controversies and lawsuits, often involving parodies of the doll and her lifestyle. Mattel has sold over a billion Barbie dolls, making it the company's largest and most profitable line.
            
            The Barbie doll brand has expanded into a media franchise, including a long-running series of animated films that began in 2001. From 2002 to 2017, the films were aired regularly on the Nickelodeon cable channel.Ken is a doll and fictional character introduced by Mattel in 1961 as the counterpart of Barbie, who was introduced two years earlier. Ken was invented by Elliot Handler.

            Ken is from Willows, Wisconsin.[1] Similar to his female counterpart, Ken has a fashionable line of clothing and accessories (although he made his debut wearing only a swim suit).[2] In the Barbie mythos, Ken met Barbie on the set of a TV commercial. He is Barbie's boyfriend, as it is written on every box produced since 1961. Since his debut, Ken has held at over 40 occupations</span>
